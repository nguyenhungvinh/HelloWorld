						<h2>1. Personal Profile</h2>
					</div>
					<ul class="resume-list">
						<li>
							<p>Greetings, it’s my pleasure to meet you. Let us have a brief introduction about myself first. My name is Vinh, you can also call me Arno. I’m Vietnamese, of course. My hometown is Can Tho city, a peaceful place located in the South region of Vietnam. I’ve lived there for 20 years before moving to live in HCM city. I am currently a sophomore of RMIT university, and my major is Information Technology just like you. I was born in 3rd August, 1999.
To be honest, I tend to be an introverted, totally different from what others people think about me just by looking at my appearance. However, it does not mean that I am not easy to make friends, I just do not have enough courage to be the one who strike first during the start of the conversation or the relationship. So, I would be grateful if you start the conversation with me. I am also fond of playing various kind of games such as RPG or MOBA, and a book worm as well. I read many kinds of books, but I mostly enjoy Japanese light novels, especially books written by well-known Japanese writer, Shinkai Makoto.
I would like to tell you something about my English name. It’s originally a Germanic name (root “arn” from “aran” – means “eagle, or as far as I concern). The first time I saw this name when I was playing so-called Assassin’s Creed game. I was struck by the main character, whose name is Arno, and ever since then, I made up my mind to choose that name as my English name, luckily my favorite animal is also eagle.

							<h2>2. Interest in IT</h2>
						</div>
						<ul class="resume-list">
							<h3>What's your interest in IT?</h3>
							<p>Ever since when I was in secondary school, I’ve realized that I have a knack for problem solving in mathematics field, as well as have a huge passion for coding and working with algorithms. After that, I’ve done some of my first research about the IT fields. There are plenty of areas in IT that hook my interest such as, AI (Artificial Intelligence), UX-UI design, Front-end Development, they all are just so amazing that I just want to study all of them. I got confused about deciding my path in the IT area for months before the GCSE exam, and later on, I luckily stumbled upon the Back-end Development and Block chain technology. Both of these 2 require to work mostly with the database and algorithms, fix bugs, just like exactly what I’ve been interested in for so long, since I’m lack of creativity so this is going to be my safest choice.
As far as I concern, Back-end Development and Block chain have a bond between them. Back-end developers take responsibility for the performance of the program or the webpage, in other words, they work for the server side, handle every behind-the-scenes activities or actions. The back-end developers focus the behind parts of the website or programs, they use code to build the “core” of the programs and the most important part, database, which provides and stores every data and performance history.
Besides, Block chain is a part of database, where every data is stored in an public database, converted in the block form and they are tracked by multiple clients. These clients are connected each other, sharing the same data so that’s why it is called block chain. Even though block chain is a public database, it’s hardly to be attacked or harmed due to the way it protects the data. Once the data is published on the database, it is unchangeable. If there’s something needs to be considered to be updated, it must be verified and have all the agreements of the clients. Therefore, the data is likely unharmable by the hackers. Owing to that, there has been many industries apply this kind of database for the transaction, the most familiar example is Bitcoin, the transactions are performed under the control of the clients around the world so it is nearly can’t be hacked due to its complex system.
</p>

							<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
							<p>I have to assure that it is more likely a story to be told. At first, RMIT was not my prior choice due to its high tuition fee. I was going to attend to the University of Finance and Marketing. In contrast, things have changed during the day I received my certificate of enrolment to UFM. My sister and her husband suddenly offered me a chance to study in RMIT. I thought that I was dreaming, just like in the cloud nine because for many years, RMIT has acquired a reputation for its top-notch education system with numbers of major for students to attend. I believe that this will be an ideal school for me to gain a deep insight into technology areas and plenty of opportunities given for students like me to find our ideal jobs and thrive our careers.
There are variety of things that I have to learn when I study in RMIT, alongside with the knowledge. I acknowledge that the study method in university is mostly independent learning, or self-study. The lecturers only guide their students the way, they have to walk on their own and find if there are other alternative ways. In other words, the teachers only provide 40% of the knowledge, the remaining part is up to the students, they have to learn it by them self by self-study or doing research, and therefore, the students will improve their research skill and be more independent. Alongside with that, presentation skill is also vital for me while I am studying here if I want to be success in the future. To be more specific, presenting can build confidence in students, which mean they know how to speak in front of people, how to control their voice and body gesture, communicate more fluently and dynamically. Henceforth, they can make a good influence to their teammates, colleagues, customers or audiences.

							<p>At the very first moment when I finished reading these the results, I was totally struck by their accuracy, for around 80% correct. I thought that these results were actually written particularly for me, and now I understand why these websites are well-known and highly recommended, even RMIT also does.
With all of the honesty, I don’t know about myself much, even my type of personality or character are both unknown. Thus, these results are just so important for me to know more about myself, as well as to make finding teammates becomes much easier, they will know what kind of person I am. Understanding each other is extremely essential when working in groups, the members will be able to know what kind of areas the other are good at and what they need to improve or be supported by the team. For me, I am recently lack of logical thinking so it would be a pleasure for me to have any teammate that are good at this area and can help me to improve it.
Like I’ve stated, I am more likely an introverted so I am currently looking for teammates who are extroverted in order to make the team be balanced. Imagine that if the team is full of introverted, there will be no one to have enough courage, or simply just because they don’t know how to express their observations to other members. Lastly, these results are just references for me so as to find the teammate easily, I never base on these results to judge anyone’s personality. We are all born to be different, it’s you who decide your own personality based on your behavior in the present and its consequence.

						<p>According to their post, they are currently hiring Backend Developer to work for their company, and the employees are required to have a solid knowledge about Python, Database and AWS, which are the main 3 areas for the development of the company. Their project strongly focuses on Artificial Technology, teach the machines how to engage and do conversations with human naturally. Right now, they are recruiting those who have a strong determination, passion on working with the Backend area, just like exactly what I feel intriguing and the job that I’m looking for.</p>
						<img src="img/Capture 3.png" alt="5">
						<p>After skimming through the requirements, I figured out they are not too hard for me to archive 65% of them while I am studying in university. To be more specific, most of the subjects of IT in RMIT cover numbers of requirements above, not only just Python, such as C, C++, Java language, HTML, CSS,… the remaining is depend on my effort that I put into my whole self-study process.
Compare to the given requisites, I am currently working with Python language and will continue to go further with it during my university life. Moreover, in a few more semester I will also be taught about database, which is also listed. Last but not least, I am a meticulous and patient person so I can do my best to avoid the errors, even if I do, I don’t mind to repeat the job from the start frequently.

						<h2>5. Project idea</h2>

					</div>
					<ul class="resume-list">

						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>As far as I have planned now, my project is mainly focus on creating a device which can give the user sense of reality even though they are in a virtualized world. This project is named Nerve Gear (NG), a helmet-like machine which allows players to merge their thoughts and brains into the device and transfer into the game. According to my plan, NG will be more advanced than the VR devices recently, which connect directly the user’s brain, neurons by microwave in order to “transfer” them into the virtualized world. This project is based on Sword Art Online novel, a well-known novel about RPG game where player can live their virtual life as the real one.</p>
						<h3>Motivation</h3>
						<p>The reason that makes me want to do this project is because I’m a fan of RPG game and love reading the Sword Art Online series, just like what I mentioned above. Since RPG games nowadays are all the rage, with a huge amount of them, and therefore, the players’ demand also increases. They want to experience something is virtual, however makes them feel real, just like they are actually living in the game, and I am no exception. </p>

						<h3>Description</h3>
						<p>As I have mentioned, NG will be a high-techno gaming device, much more advanced than VR machines in the future, where gamers not just they feel like they are living in the game, but it’s actually they are experiencing the reality in the virtual world. NG consists of high-density of microwave transceiver, which is capable of blocking the physical body movement sensory to avoid the players from moving and harming themselves while sending fake signal to their brain and spinal cord, making them completely insensate in the real life but live their physical life in the virtualized world.
First of all, each user will have their own ID and data, merged with the NG device when they registered the account. Later then, the account and other related data will be sent to the client and stored on the main database. I am planning to create the database by applying the blockchain system due to its security. As I’ve mentioned, blockchain database can avoid 90% chance of being hacked, so it will be much safer for the users. After logging in to the device, the command from the main processor will be immediately sent to the transceiver to create the microwave and then, the movement command from the brain to the central nervous system will completely blocked and start controlling the user’s consciousness, while the fake sensory signal will be transferred into the brain and the spinal cord to make them feel they are physically interacting with the game, even though in reality they are not moving and remaining out cold. In addition, while experiencing the game, players can freely to adjust the physical aspects to make them feel much more “real”. To be more specific, they can set the painful level to make them feel like they just took the “real damage”, or even the temperature, …
On the other hands, there will be an automatic switch installed into the NG, which is an emergency log out switch. Because the device will directly interact with the brain and the neuron system, therefore it can also detect whenever the user’s health is abnormal. If that happens, the safe log out command will be immediately executed, cut out all of the micro signal and return the user back into their reality.
However, that’s not all the NG can do. NG’s main function is to create a physical simulator environment for human kind, thus it can be applied to numbers of areas, not only just for gaming. For instance, in army they can use it as a training system to improve the soldier’s shooting accuracy, simulate a battle field to make them familiar with war and train their reflex. It can come in handy for reducing the cost of producing weapons for the soldier’s training. Another positive example is applying for the medical field. NG will be the ideal way for the new doctors to train their surgery skill and they don’t have to interact with the death bodies.
</p>

						<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
						<p>As far as I have planned, NG will be programmed via Unity, the best well-known application for creating game. Along side with that, its language will be Python or C++, C# because based on CodeMonkey’s recommendation, these languages will be the most suitable languages for game coding in Unity. Java and JavaScript will also be put in consider. More than 50% of the VR device will be applied to create the NG machine in the future because they share some similar features and functions.

						<h3>Skills required</h3>
						<p>In order to be success in this project, I have to put all of my effort to study and gain deep knowledge about the mentioned languages above. Furthermore, machine learning and database knowledge are also essential for my project. Right now, I am getting used of interacting with Python, hopefully I can get familiar with it as soon as possible.</p>

						<h3>Outcome</h3>
						<p>Until now, this is just an idea of a junior like me so I still can’t be able to measure the prize correctly, however, due to its high-tech function, it will cost the consumers an arm and a leg to afford this device. Despite the prize is not cheap, but for the long-term plan, it will help the governments around the world save a large amount of money for the gaming. army and medical invention.</p>
